# A virtual library by leveraging Web Storage API (localStorage)

> ## Developed as a part of The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library)

> ## This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

> - [Live demo](https://maaahad-virtual-library.herokuapp.com)

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Future work

1. Use `memo` to avoid the rendering of full book list on any changes to library.
2. Add category option to book.
3. Add `Filter` and `Sort` functionality
4. Accept `book cover` on book addition
